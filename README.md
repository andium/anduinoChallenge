# Here's your task!

This repo serves as a place to host the OpenSource IoT Intern challenge utilizing Anduino. 

To participate in this challenge, fork this repo, code, assemble, integrate, and implement all pieces necessary to send a push notification to your phone (passing whatever message you'd like) when you push a push button!

# Your Toolbox

* [Arduino Due](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardDue)
* [Aduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
* [AnduinoWiFi](https://github.com/andium/Anduino)
* [Adafruit.io](https://io.adafruit.com/)
* [GitHub](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)

Other hardware provided to you...
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires
* PushButton 

# Getting Started

If you haven't already, you'll want to create accounts on GitHub, Adafruit.IO, and IFTTT. Download the Arduino IDE and be sure to include the boards package for the Arduino Due. Test out your environment with a simple Blinky example and then start downloading libraries you'll need and scaling up your design. 

You'll be using the Arduino Due to host the AnduinoWiFi shield and to run the code that waits for the button push and then sends a notification to your cell phone(hint: download the IFTTT app!)

# When you're ready...

Once you've tested and you think you have all the code necessary to complete the task, submit a pull request to this repo and be sure to fill in the howTo.md with a brief write up explaining the moving parts of the project and higlighting some cool features!

# Bonus Points

* Display the message being sent on AnduinoWiFi LCD Display.
* Initiate a message to be displayed on the LCD from the cloud.

# Feeling adventurous?
Complete the same task without utilizng IFTTT or Adafruit.IO

# Good Luck!!!
